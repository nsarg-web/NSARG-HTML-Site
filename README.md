# NSARG-HTML-Site
HTML and CSS site 2019
Hi, thanks for taking a look at our projects.
This is a journey of self learning and a way to show people about our hobby.
|The actual production website can be found at www.nsarg.co.uk.

We are not professional devs, so you may find many items that could be improved with a simple change.
If you would like to help, or advise then please get in touch.

Many thanks
Northampton Scout amateur radio group.
